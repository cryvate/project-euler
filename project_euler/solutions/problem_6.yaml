title: Sum square difference
description: >
    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
    natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
    hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

    The answer obeys a polynomial that can be proven by induction. The
    polynomial is: n^4 / 4 + n^3 / 6 - n^2 / 4 - n / 6
