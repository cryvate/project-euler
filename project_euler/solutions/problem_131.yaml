title: Prime Cube Partnership
description: >
    There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n^3 + n^2p is a perfect cube.

    For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82Ã—19 = 123.

    What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

    How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

    If we assume gcd(n, p) = 1, we find that n is a cube itself, leading to
    k^3(k^3 + p) being a cube, which would suggest that p is a difference of
    cubes, and due to the factoring of x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)
    this means it must be successive cubes.
