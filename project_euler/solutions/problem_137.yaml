title: Fibonacci golden nuggets
description: >
    Consider the infinite polynomial series AF(x) = xF1 + x2F2 + x3F3 + ..., where Fk is the kth term in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... ; that is, F_k = F_{k−1} + F_{k−2}, F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

    For this problem we shall be interested in values of x for which AF(x) is a positive integer.

    Surprisingly AF(1/2)	 = 	(1/2).1 + (1/2)2.1 + (1/2)3.2 + (1/2)4.3 + (1/2)5.5 + ...
       = 	1/2 + 1/4 + 2/8 + 3/16 + 5/32 + ...
       = 	2
    The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.

    x	AF(x)
    √2−1	1
    1/2	2
    (√13−2)/3	3
    (√89−5)/8	4
    (√34−3)/5	5
    We shall call AF(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 10th golden nugget is 74049690.

    Find the 15th golden nugget.

    We have
      AF(x) = x / (1 - x - x^2)
    From this we have a necessary and sufficient condition for x = p / q to
    have AF(x) be an integer to be
      p^2 + pq - q^2 | pq
    From using Stern Brocot tree spot that the relevant p and q are successive
    Fibonacci numbers, moreover it is all of these if allowing integers
    (swapping sign, because crossing over zero of 1 - x - x^2), and so we find
    that there is a closed form. Moreover, more staring gives that the nuggets
    are the 7th, 11th, ... Fibonacci numbers, however this is not faster for
    generating large Fibonacci numbers. (in fact, this problem gives a result
    that can be used to compute large Fibonacci numbers faster if you care not
    about intermediates).
