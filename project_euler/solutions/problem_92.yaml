title: Square Digit Chains
description: >
    A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

    For example,

    44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → 1 → 1
    85 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89

    Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.

    How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?

    First, consider the maximal sum we can get (quite small), then find out
    whether it leeads to 89 or 1, cache this.

    Then, consider the combinations of digits, then if they go to 89,
    compute its 'contribution' and we add it to an accumulater.
