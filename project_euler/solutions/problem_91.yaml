title: Right Triangles with Integer Coordinates
description: >
    The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

    There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
    0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 2.

    Given that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be formed?

    Consider the point that is where the right angle.

    The O case leads to 50 * 50.

    Otherwise, without loss of generality assume it is at P and anti-clockwise
    for angle OPQ. We then need to multiply by 2. Then consider the normal,
    and divide it by the greatest common divisor of the coordinates of P,
    then consider the amount of 'steps' we can do of those.
