title: Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal
description: >
    Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

    Triangle	 	Tn=n(n+1)/2	 	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
    Pentagonal	 	Pn=n(3n−1)/2	 	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
    Hexagonal	 	Hn=n(2n−1)	 	1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

    It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

    Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

    The condition on 2 means exactly that d_4 is even.

    The condition on 5 means exactly that d_6 is divisible by 5.

    Consider these first, then simply permute the others.
