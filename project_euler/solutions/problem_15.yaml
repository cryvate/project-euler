description: >
    Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

    How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

    NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
