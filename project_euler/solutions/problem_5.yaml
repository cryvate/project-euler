title: Smallest multiple
description: >
    2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

    What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

    They are asking for the lowest common denominator, and we have from
    number theory: lcd(a, b) = a * b / gcd(a, b) and lcd(a, b, ..., y, z) =
    lcd(lcd(a, b, ..., y), z): so we simply compute it recursively.

    For bigger numbers, using prime factorisation would be better.
