title: Integer Right Triangles
description: >
    If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

    {20, 48, 52}, {24, 45, 51}, {30, 40, 50}

    For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
