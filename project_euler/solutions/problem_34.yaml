description: >
    145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

    Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

    Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

    Simple brute-force. Can also work backwards by only considering
    combinations instead of permutations of numbers to reduce search space.
