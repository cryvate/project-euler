title: Even Fibonacci numbers
description: >
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
    previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
    exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    Every third Fibonacci number is even. Some math shows that the following
    recurrence holds: E_n = 4E_(n - 1) + E_(n - 2). One could take this a
    step further and find what the recurrence relation for the sum of the
    first n terms of E_n is, and use an estimation to find out what n is.
    None of this is implemented."
