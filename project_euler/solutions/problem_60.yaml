title: Prime Pair Set
description: >
    The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.

    Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.

    Do pairs first, then triplets, then quadruplets, then quintuplets.

    To add a number, check just the pairings. Make sure to store the
    pairings in such a way that they can be easily looked-up (or seen to not
    be there), simply using Python 'in' doesn't work.
