title: Special Pythagorean triplet
description: >
    A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for
    which,

    a^2 + b^2 = c^2

    For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

    There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
    Find the product abc.

    Use the parametrization of Pythagorean triplets by (m, n, d) as:

    a = (m^2 - n^2) * d
    b = 2 * m * n * d
    c = (m^2 + n^2) * d

    where exactly one of m and n is even and gcd(m, n) = 1. We find

    a + b + c = 2 * m * (m + n) * d.

    One could use prime factorisation to speed up the process as well, but
    this is not implemented here.
